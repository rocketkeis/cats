### Reminders

CLAYGO so that the cats won't get into trouble with the admins of the place

* Try not to overfeed. Left-overs might invite ants/rats.
* Small portion only if feeding without a plate.

Cattendance after feeding

* Message is sent to the Viber group to let folks know you're done with the feeding
* Also lets us know who's been MIA, or who was previously MIA who then showed up
